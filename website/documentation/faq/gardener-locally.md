title: How can you deploy Gardener locally?
---

If you need information on how to deploy your cluster on your local machine, a step-by-step tutorial can be found at [Running Gardener locally](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/development/getting_started_locally/). 

You can also watch the recorded [Community Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV_JI8YWwY4&ab_channel=GardenerProject) to get a better understanding of the process.
